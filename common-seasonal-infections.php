                        <p>
                            Seasonal infections are illnesses that commonly occur during particular times of the year,
                            often triggered by climate changes, humidity, temperature drops, or monsoon conditions.
                            These infections include viral fevers, influenza, common cold, cough, throat infections, and
                            various types of allergies. Children, the elderly, and people with weaker immune systems are
                            especially vulnerable.

                        seasonal changes can make a big difference.
