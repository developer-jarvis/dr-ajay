                        <p>
                            Thyroid disorders are among the most common endocrine problems affecting millions of people
                            worldwide. Whether it's hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or other thyroid imbalances, timely
                            management is essential for maintaining energy levels, metabolism, and overall health. At
                            Dr. Ajay’s Clinic, located on Boring Road, Patna, we specialize in comprehensive thyroid
                            disorder management with advanced diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and continuous
                            monitoring.

                        <h3 class="subtitle">Understanding Thyroid Disorders</h3>
                        <p>
                            The thyroid gland, located in the neck, is responsible for producing hormones that regulate
                            metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, and energy levels. When the thyroid does not
                            function properly, it leads to either underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or overactive
                            thyroid (hyperthyroidism), each bringing its own set of symptoms and risks. Other disorders
                            like goiter, thyroid nodules, and autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease and Graves'
                            disease) also require expert attention.

                            Untreated thyroid disorders can lead to serious health issues like infertility, heart
                            diseases, goiter, and metabolic imbalances. Early detection and the right approach can
