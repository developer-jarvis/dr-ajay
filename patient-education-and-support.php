                    <p>
                        At Dr. Ajay’s Clinic in Patna, we believe that informed patients make healthier decisions. Our
                        patient education and support services are designed to provide clear, accurate, and practical

                        <h5>Why Patient Education Matters</h5>
                        <p>
                            When patients understand their conditions, treatments, and preventive care measures, they
                            feel empowered to make proactive decisions. Our aim is to demystify complex medical concepts
                            and help you stay well-informed. Whether it's understanding medications, managing chronic
                            diseases, or making lifestyle changes, education is at the core of better healthcare
                            outcomes.
